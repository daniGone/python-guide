    "## Strings\n",
    "Strings are basically characters, like the word 'rickroll', in python, we strings inside of double or single quotes, both works so you can have your preference. Thats why in the third part of this tutorial, I explicitly put single quotes, because that was a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integers\n",
    "Inters are basically numbers, like 123 you notice how I didnt put any type of quotes? Because for intergers we dont put that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "can you do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('123')\n",

    "# Booleans\n",
    "Booleans are basically True or False, now... please note that booleans are case sensitive so typing true wont work, also you dont need to have quotes, if you have quotes it will just print the acctuall 'True' and will also be identified as a string."
