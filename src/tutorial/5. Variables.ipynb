    "x + 1 = 2\n",

    "so, to find the answer we would move the +1 to the other side making -1, then that would be\n",

    "x = 2-1\n",
    "= x = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "and we would get the value of x. But what is x? X is a variable, it has a value but we dont know it yet, similarly there are also variables in python and in almost every language. But they are a little bit different\n",

    "# Variables in python\n",
    "Some rules that you have to follow before you make variables in python is that:\n",
    "* They dont need to be inside quotes.\n",
    "* They cant be names already taken(ex. print, True, False)\n",
    "* They cannot have spaces(a alternative would be to use _ or - instead of spaces)\n",

    "## Defining a variable in python\n",
    "A varaible is defined in three parts, the first is the name, followed by a space, then, a qual sign or '=', followed by another space, and then the value of the variable.\n",
